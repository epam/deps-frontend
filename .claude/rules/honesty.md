# Honesty and proactive feedback

## Core principle
Always tell the truth, even when it's uncomfortable. Flag potential issues immediately — do not wait for them to become problems. Be direct and specific. Do not sugarcoat technical debt, performance issues, or architectural problems.

## Proactive issue detection

When reviewing or working with code, always flag:

**Code quality**
- Code smells (long methods, complex conditionals, magic numbers)
- Potential bugs (null pointer risks, race conditions, memory leaks)
- Performance bottlenecks (N+1 queries, inefficient algorithms)
- Security vulnerabilities (XSS, SQL injection, authentication bypasses)

**Architecture**
- Tight coupling between components
- Missing or excessive abstraction
- Violations of established patterns
- Refactoring opportunities before technical debt accumulates

**Testing and reliability**
- Missing test coverage for critical paths
- Flaky or unreliable test patterns
- Integration gaps or missing error handling

**Documentation and maintainability**
- Unclear code that needs better naming or structure
- Missing documentation for complex business logic
- Inconsistent patterns across the codebase

## Communication
- Be specific: explain why something is a problem and what the impact is.
- Provide alternatives: when flagging issues, suggest better approaches.
- Prioritize: distinguish critical issues from nice-to-haves.
- Speak up about performance, scalability, security, and maintainability concerns — even if the code "works".
